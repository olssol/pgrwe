Description: Performance goals are numerical target values pertaining to
  effectiveness or safety endpoints in single-arm medical device clinical
  studies. Typically, performance goals are determined at the planning stage of
  the investigational study under consideration based upon summarized outcome
  information from existing relevant clinical trials. In recent years, there is
  a growing interest in leveraging real-world evidence in medical product
  development. In this package, we implement a new method for proposing
  performance goals by leveraging real-world evidence. The method applies
  entropy balancing to address possible patient dissimilarities between the
  target patient population and existing real-world patients.
